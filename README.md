 I am Mark, a self-taught iOS developer who started teaching myself how to code a while before entering college when I didn't even know how to print "Hello, World". My mission is to expand the community of diary&journaling in order to let people know how wonderful it is to keep memories and appreciate the most valuable asset of our life, time.

My host mom in the US passed away and what I wrote in the diary every single day for 10 months reflects how beautiful it is to keep our stories and memories in the diary.

I dreamt, I learnt, I designed, I built and I am truly passionate about iOS development and I am on my way to make this world the most wonderful place by making dream a reality, in this case, building an app and a well-crafted project.
